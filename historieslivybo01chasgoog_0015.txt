..-.--—---

’ Irus LIVIUS was a lew years younger than Virgil and Horace, ,

but older than Propertius and Ovid, with whom he shines in the
brilliant constellation of genius which adorna the Augustan age. He
was born probably in the year 59 or 57 B. 0, at Patavium, now Padua,
which in his day was a populous and wealthy city, while iamed at the
sometime lor strictness of morale. Livy was probably cs an equestrian

Ι family3 brad and living in that middle rank which is so favorable for

the development cf character and talant. 'Pheraia some reason to
believe that he was a teacher of rhetoric. He wrote books on philoso-

enjoyed the friendship of Augustus, and it was his counsel which
indnced the emperor's grandson, claudius-who was afterwards
emperor,-to apply his attention to the writing ol historical works.

the purpose of seeing the author of the great Roman history, and
returned as soon as he had satisfied his curiosity. une historiari died
in his nativa city, A. D. l'l. ¹

une first decad (or ten books) oi Livy'r “ colossal history ” appears ’
to have been written between the years 27 and 20 Β. G. The whole
work consisted, lt has been supposed, ol one hundred end fortytwo

books, cavering the whole period from the foundation of the city till the ·

year 9 Β. O.,· hut Niebuhr suggests that the author probably intended
to complete fifteen decedebat died before he could accomplish his
object. “llis purpose in undertaking it was to draw, with all the
charms which his artistic skill and delicate taste could give, accmplete
picture of tlre history cf the Roman people, and ol the laudable or
blamewcrthy peculiarities cf its prominent personages, that he might
inflame the patriotic feelings of his countrymen, and contribute tc the
instruction and entertainment ol the world at large. Livy generally
looks at an historical event cr character from a moral point ol view:
he wishes to excita our admiration oi the great, love of the good, and
