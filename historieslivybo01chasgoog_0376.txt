is intended as a text-book sor Schools and Academies. lt is
designed t'or the use ol those who have not the time to devote

to the study of Literature as laid down in the larger books oi
the Series.

· Hert's muel oi English literature is intendedas e text-
book ior Colleges‚ and as a book oi reference.

Hert’s moal ol Amerloan Literatnre is a companion volume
to the “English Literature‚” with which it corresponds in
general character and design. It is intended as a text-book sor
Colleges, and as a book os reference.

In these volumes Prot. Hart has embodied the matured fruita
ol his life-long studies in this department os letters. We believe
they will be found in advance oi any other text-books on the
subject, in the comprehensiveness os the plan, the ireshness of
much of the materials, the sound judgment shown in the critical
opinions, the clearness with which the several topics are pre-
sented, and the beauty as well as the practicnl convenience ol the
mechanical arrangements.

The scholarly culture and excellent literary judgment dis·
*played entitle these books to a high place among the works on
English literature. The plan and arrangement present many
novel features, and the thoroughness of detail, brevity and pre·
cision of statement, elegance os style, and soundness of opinion
which characterize the volumes, call sor the sincerest commen·

dation.
