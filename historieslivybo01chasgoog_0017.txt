the whole work.

Unfcrtuaately, the lurger part of this great history is no longer

The peculiarities of Livy's style, us distinguished from Cicero end

useof words. 2. Poetiodictioa. 3. Peculiaritiesof syntex. tere

Taking materials from old chronioles und (iu the history of the kings)
from Ennius, he eosily adopted their fortas of expression: hence

tur of virgil, und certainly he uses many words which, while found
in the poets, ure never met with in the older prose writers. 'l'be poetic
coloriuy of his style appears also in the use of simple verbs for cota-

dative instead of the ablativo with u or of the accusative with ml, is
not particularly frequent. 'l'he neuter of the perfect passive participle
often stunds alone in Livy in the ablativo absolute. The coristic use
of the perfect indicative insteud of the pluperfeot, und of the perfect
subjunctive instead of the imperfect, is common to Livy, Nepos,
Sallust, Tacitus, und other historicus. More exceptionel is Livy's lre·

direct questions, but also in the oratio obliquo. This use, however, is
contined to pussoges in erutions which Livy puts in the mouth cf
another person. He uses sometimes the infinitivo for the gerund‚ pur.
