ticles prope end paene with the verb is mnoh more common with Livy
than with other writers. He uses the participles with unusual fre-
qneney ond boldneas. 4. (Before proceeding tc tho fourth head, 1 ean-
not forbeor remnrking that the term “tidelm’' ia used by Grysar in
some cases too freely, as it has also boen uunccessarily employed hy
many grammaticos, to indicate constructione which are as natural aud
idiomatic in Latin as in Greek. (See Greenough on rte torro Set·
jerrcriee, p. 15.) tt is true, however, that such constructione were often
developed aad extended from the influence of Greek writers; aud a
pere Grecism is occasionally found.) Among Livy’a Grecisrne‚ Gryaar
numbers the adjective use of participles lin Greek preceded bytho arti-
ole), aa adhortatio inuicem ‚· od explorando elren loca,· the connectiones
intransitive verbs with abstract substantivas derived from them; the use
of collective nonas with apluml verb ς thefreo usehoth of the genitiveto
show the respect in which tho signification of an adjective ia taken. and
of tha accusative of specification3 the use of the participle for an ab·
street substantive, us deponendum ire aliie (i. rap freedom ia attrac-
tion, as raptim, quibos quisque poterat, elatis (i. 29); and finally
various Greek modes of expressiones qaid or (iveri), ertroqeom ri
(ferde rt μὴ), cnm eo ut (ἅμα τοῖσδε), und qurum pro (ἦ κατὰ or ἣ πρὸς) after a
comparative, as xxi. 29 and 32: which lost construction is never found
in Cicero or Caesar, though often in Tacitus. 5. hivy's cerrrrrrrcrlrnr
ara often bold and poetical, sometimes perhaps too evidently artificial.
6. He sometimes incerte too many short clarence, to the injury of tha
symmetry and cleerness of the sentence. Το aum up, Livy sppears, in
accordnnce with the teste of his ege, to have deperted somewhat from
the simplieity and strength of etrlier writers, and to hove songht to
add a chsrm to his style hy novelty and greater freedom of expression.

I snbjoin Zumpt's statement of the distinction between the stylos
of Livy and Cicero:

“This differenoe is principally to be found in Livy’s frequent intro·
ductiou of poet-ioal words and construetione into his prose: e. g. tem·
pestus for temptes, mor-tales for lonaeirer, letum for trem, clepere fornicare,
or opere ricem, que-que for etet ; further, iu the use of the mere eblo-
tive without the preposition in, to express place ‘where ;’ in the pleo-
nastic employrncut of edverbs, with compound verbs, to strengthcn the
meaning of the proposition contained in the verb; a. g. prior proeel-
pere, ursle praeoccupare, retro repetere, rursus reperere, retro redire, per·-
yere porro, indecere exercitum r'n cyrum lenirem ,- in collective nouns in
the singular being connected with ο predicate in the plural: c. g. ornrrr'e
mulcedo abeunt ,stuperet turbu cfrounrfioeisrenubeot ,· elenwr corrcursueqoe
