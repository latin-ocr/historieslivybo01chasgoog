ln every High School and Academy in the land, the organiza-
tion of a class in Commercial Arithmetic, Business Calculations
and Forms, will prove an elementof popularity and successthat
will yield rich results. The sule'ect itsels is so intrinsically valu-
able as a means of developing thought, that, were this the only
result to be gained, it would be entitled to and should receive
the special attention os the progressive teacher. But apart from
this, the introduction of a study so interesting in itself, so attrac-
tive to the scholar, and having so direct a bearing on his future
welfare, will, in many an instance, decide the welsareof a school,
directing the channel os popular opinion in its favor, and prove the
means os filling it with students anxious to secure its advantages.

Circulars containing lull descriptive notice, testimonials‚ δια,
will be sent to any address on application.
