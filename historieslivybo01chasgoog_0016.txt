LIVY AND HIS HISTOBY OF Rosia. ix

hatred 01 the bad; he feels a prend pleasure in descrihing the power
cf the Romane, er the purity of manners hy which they were at first
distinguishcd; ond the history of the early ages of the state seems to
have consoled him for the wickedness and wretcheduees which he had
seen aud felt during the civil ware. His conservatisrn, und habitual
admiration of the olden times above the modern, merely because they
were the oldeu times, are exhibited in the carly parts of his work,
especially in hie description of the conteets between the patricians and
plebeians. Livy’s partiality to the patriciana may well be blamed, his
conservatism, however, never led him to wink at cruelty or boseness,
or to conceal or knowingly misstste facts.¹' Truth he held ae a sacred
thing. At the same time he was strangely wanting ln that careful,
laborioue research, ond that slsill in weighiug and sifting evidence,
which are among the foremost requisites of the historico. He took
. such materiale ns came to hand, founding himself especially upon the
annalista, eontenting himself with purging them of their absurdities,
and arranging their boet matter in an attractiva form. thre they
disagreed, he endeavered to deoida between them “with the judgment
of a mnu of sense,” hut not by any well-ascertained philosophical
principles of historical eritieism. “ However turbid the current of his
information, in uo ease did he ever dream 01 ascending to the fouutain·
head. He never attempted toltest the occuracy of the assertione of
others by exomiuing ancient monuments, or investigating the an·
tiquities of the various italien tribes.” He neema mereorer, to have
performed his tosk pieoemeal, without taking a broad aad comprehen-
sive view 01 his whole subject. Iu thehistory of the kings, he followed
Ennius. With Polybius he was nasoquainted until after he had re-
lated the first half of the Punic war; throughout the fourth decad,
however, he adheresveryolosely lo that “incomparable” authority.
Of the details of the geography even 01 his own country, he betrays a
singular ignorasse, which greatly impeirs the valne ef his narrative.
In a simply literary point of view, however, Livy's composition is
almost faultless. His narrative “ flows on in acalru hut strong current,
clear and sparkling but deep oud nabuthen, the diction displays rich· .
nese without hominess, and simplicity without tameness. Nor is his
art as a painter less wonderful. There is o distinctncss 01 outline und
a warmth of coloring in all his delineatione, whether 01 living meo in
action, or 01 things inanirnote, which never fail to coll up tho whole
scene, with all it's adjuncto, before our eyes.” Upon the whole, look-

ing at the work both iu ite externat and interual characteristics, we
may well say to studente of Livy, in the words of Niebuhr (Lectum i.
