This book is what its title indicates, “ First Lessons in Natural
Philosophy; ” and it presents each division os the subjec't in such
an easy end familiar style, that it cannot t'ail to interest and in·
struet any child of ordinary intelligence. Beginning as it does
in a simple and easy manner, it secures the interest of the pupil
by first directing his attention to objects in nature with which he
issamiliar. When the interest is thus excited‚ the subjectis
gradually untotded by presenting, one aster another, the familiar
things met with in the every-day wallss of life; thus, the most
common objects are made the means os teaching great philo-
sophical truths. Only so much of the subject is presented as can
be taught with profit in our public and private schools, yet what
has been given will be found to embrace all the more common
phenomenn met with in every-day lit . The facts are so clearly
and so plainly set forth, that they are entirely capable os corn-

prehension by those sor whose use and benefit this little work is
designed.
