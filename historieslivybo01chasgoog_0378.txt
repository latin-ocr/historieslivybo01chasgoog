delphia Central High School. Price by mail,
postpaid‚ 3125.

The present work is the result of an effort to produce an Ele-
mentary Algebra suited to the wants of classes commencing the
study. It has been prepared by one who for years has felt the
need of just such a book, aud is the fruit of long experience
in the school-room.

With this book in hand, the pupil cannot help avoiding the
difficulties which invariably present themselves at the very
threshold of the study of Algebra

It hasbeen the aim to give such apresentation ofthe subject
as will meet the wants ol Common Schools and Academies. It
is an elementary work, and no attempt has been made to include
everything which might be brought under the head of Algebra.
The treatment of the subject is on the principle of “step by
step‚’' so that the pupil at the very outset is inspired with a de·
grecos confidence which induces sels-reliance; rendering un·
necessary a constant application to the teacher for help.

'lhe book is commended to teachers in the hope that it wisst
satisfy anecd which the author has himself frequently felt.
