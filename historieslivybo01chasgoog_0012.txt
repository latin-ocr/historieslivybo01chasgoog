THE text of Livy, though handed down by the

manuscripts in an imperfect and unsatisfactory
state, has been in a great degree resoued and restored

Hert-z, and above all Weissenborn, cannot pass un-

opposed. There is, it is true, one in this list, whom
a man might follow even with bis eyes shut, and feel
assured that he would never be led far astray. The
unrivalled sagaoity with which the great Danish
philologist scente out the true reading in a taugled
maneos hopeless obscurity is one of the marvels of ’
our later day. Itis hard to resist the fascination of
such genius ·, yet, with due diffidenoe, Ι may say that
